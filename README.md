###Grbl porting to non-AVR platforms
This fork of Grbl contains some porting attempts. It's still work in progress and is delivered as-is with no warranty.

Porting attempts are focused on HiFive1 at the moment. HiFive1 is an open source chip based on the fully open RISCV architecture developed at UC Berkley.

###Building Instructions
To build for AVR-based platforms:
* make -f Makefile.avr
To build for HiFive1:
* make -f Makefile.hifive


###From Grbl's official README:

Grbl is a no-compromise, high performance, low cost alternative to parallel-port-based motion control for CNC milling. This version of Grbl runs on an Arduino with a 328p processor (Uno, Duemilanove, Nano, Micro, etc).

The controller is written in highly optimized C utilizing every clever feature of the AVR-chips to achieve precise timing and asynchronous operation. It is able to maintain up to 30kHz of stable, jitter free control pulses.

It accepts standards-compliant g-code and has been tested with the output of several CAM tools with no problems. Arcs, circles and helical motion are fully supported, as well as, all other primary g-code commands. Macro functions, variables, and most canned cycles are not supported, but we think GUIs can do a much better job at translating them into straight g-code anyhow.

Grbl includes full acceleration management with look ahead. That means the controller will look up to 16 motions into the future and plan its velocities ahead to deliver smooth acceleration and jerk-free cornering.
